7. Feature: To follow the convention where the user himself can request that his data be removed, following the general data protection law, meaning that he may lose access to the system as his personal data is removed, we include the removal endpoint / users/delete, you must be logged in so that the system can retrieve the information from the authenticated token to search for the user in the database and remove it.
