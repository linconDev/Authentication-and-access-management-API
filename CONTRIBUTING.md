# Contributing Guidelines

Looking to contribute something? Here's how you can help.

## Bugs reports

A bug is a demonstrable problem that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. Use the GitHub issue search — check if the issue has already been reported.
2. Check if the issue has been fixed — try to reproduce it using the latest main or development branch in the repository.
3. Isolate the problem — ideally create a reduced test case and a live example.
4. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. Include specific information about the environment - operating system and version, browser and version... and steps required to reproduce the issue.
